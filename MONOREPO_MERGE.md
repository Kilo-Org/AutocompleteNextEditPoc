# Monorepo Merge Summary

## Overview

Successfully merged all packages into a unified monorepo structure. All package.json files remain in place (not moved), but dependencies and configurations are now consolidated at the root level.

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Baseline (commit 7fcb7f48)
- Established baseline with all tests passing
- Created backup commit before any changes

### Phase 2: Configuration Alignment (commit d660df92)
- Created `.eslintrc.shared.json` to fix missing ESLint config
- Upgraded `@typescript-eslint/parser` from ^7.8.0 to ^8.40.0
- Aligned TypeScript tooling versions across packages

### Phase 3: Tree-sitter Consolidation (commit cfa5686c)
- Moved `core/tag-qry/*.scm` to `tree-sitter/tag-queries/`
- Consolidated all tree-sitter configuration under root directory
- Updated code references in `core/util/treeSitter.ts`
- All 16 tag query files preserved

### Phase 4: Dependency Consolidation (commit e81f8320)
- Hoisted shared devDependencies to root:
  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@^8.40.0`
  - `@typescript-eslint/parser@^8.40.0`
  - `eslint@^8`
  - `vitest@^3.1.4`
- Removed duplicates from core and vscode-test-harness packages
- All runtime dependencies remain in their respective packages

### Phase 5: Script Consolidation (commit 1d335e91)
- Added root-level aggregation scripts:
  - `npm test` - runs all tests (core + harness)
  - `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript validation
  - `npm run build` - compiles core package
  - `npm run lint` / `lint:fix` - code quality checks
- Improved developer experience with unified commands

### Phase 6: TypeScript Project References (commit da7c26e8)
- Configured TypeScript workspace with project references
- Enabled incremental compilation with `composite: true`
- Created proper dependency graph between packages
- Improved build performance and IDE support

## Preserved Functionality

✅ Autocomplete functionality - all tests pass
✅ NextEdit functionality - all tests pass  
✅ Tree-sitter configuration - consolidated and working
✅ All indirect dependencies preserved
✅ 707 total tests passing (621 core + 86 harness)

## Developer Workflow

### From Root Directory
```bash
npm install          # Install all dependencies
npm test            # Run all tests
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript validation
npm run build       # Build core package
npm run lint        # Run ESLint
npm run format      # Format code
npx tsc --build     # Incremental TypeScript build
```

### From Core Directory
```bash
cd core
npm test            # Run core tests only
npm run tsc:check   # TypeScript check
npm run lint        # ESLint check
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Dependencies**: Shared tools managed at root level
2. **Faster Builds**: Incremental TypeScript compilation
3. **Better DX**: All commands available from root
4. **Cleaner Structure**: Tree-sitter files organized in one place
5. **Improved IDE Support**: TypeScript project references enable better navigation

## Testing

All functionality verified:
- ✅ 621 tests pass in core package
- ✅ 86 tests pass in vscode-test-harness
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
- ✅ ESLint configuration working
- ✅ Incremental builds functional
- ✅ Clean install works from scratch

## Notes

- Package.json files remain in place (not deleted or moved)
- Lock files preserved at each level for npm
- All autocomplete and NextEdit code untouched
- Tree-sitter configurations fully preserved
